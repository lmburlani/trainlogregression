# trainlogregression
training a logistic regression model with a study database and using data exploration
let's assume my client is a credit company, they have brought us a dataset that includes some demographics and recent financial data (the past six months) for a sample of 30,000 of their account holders. My goal is to develop a predictive model for whether an account will default next month using logistic regression
The data has already been processed and we only have what will be useful
I want to describe the workings of logistic regression, formulate the sigmoid and logit versions of logistic regression, customize some graphs (why not right?) And characterize the linear decision boundary of a logistic regression
